      <p>The 18th Amendment was a very controversial law, and many people sought to either promote it or counteract it. Below is an example of a court case in Ohio, where A governor sent out a poll on whether to enforce the 18th Amendment or not, and somebody thought it was unconstitutional to leave choices like these up to the people.</p>
      <br><br>
      <p>
        In Apr 23, 1920, in Hamilton, Ohio, After the Ohio General Assembly ratified the 18th amendment, the General Assembly sent out a referendum to the people in compliance with an amendment to the Ohio constitution. George Hawke felt that the amendment to the Ohio constitution conflicted with article 5 of the US constitution, which stated that Amendments are ratified by state legislatures and not by the people. Hawke demanded that they stop sending out petitions and he brought Harvey Smith, the Ohio secretary of state, to court.
The court ruled in favor of the Plaintiff, George Hawke.
The court stated that the amendment to the Ohio constitution conflicted with article 5 of the United States constitution. “The function of a state legislature in ratifying a proposed amendment to the federal Constitution is not to let the people decide, but to decide for them.”
The case Hawke v. Smith made an impact on society by making people think that maybe our country isn’t led by the people, but rather by the few in power. If the majority of the people in a state don’t want a law passed, but the state legislature still passes it, are the people really more powerful than the government? This decision affected people greatly, and the ruling was extremely controversial. This stopped other states from repealing amendments by popular vote.
