        <h3>18th Amendment?</h3>
        <p><em>Section 1
                <br>
                After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of
                intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United
                States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.
                <br>
                <br>
                Section 2
                <br>
                The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate
                legislation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Section 3
                <br>
                This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution
                by the legislatures of the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the
                date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress.
            </em>
            <br><br>
            That is the 18th amendment, as written in the constitution. My simplified interpretation of that is: 'One
            year after this law is passed, you can no longer transport, sell, or buy alcohol for recreation.'
        </p>
        <h3>Rights, Protections, and Privileges</h3>
        <p>The Rights that this amendment give the people are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Right to drink alcohol, but you are not allowed to buy it from someone or sell it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The protections that this amendment gives the people are as follows:</p>
