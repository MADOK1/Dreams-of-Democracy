            <h3>18th Amendment?</h3>
            <p><em>Section 1
                    <br>
                    After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of
                    intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the
                    United
                    States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby
                    prohibited.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Section 2
                    <br>
                    The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by
                    appropriate
                    legislation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Section 3
                    <br>
                    This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the
                    Constitution
                    by the legislatures of the several States, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from
                    the
                    date of the submission hereof to the States by the Congress.
                </em>
                <br><br>
                That is the 18th amendment, as written in the constitution. My simplified interpretation of that is:
                'One
                year after this law is passed, you can no longer transport, sell, or buy alcohol for recreation.'
            </p>
            <h3>Rights, Protections, and Privileges</h3>
            <p>The Rights that this amendment give the people are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Right to drink alcohol, but you are not allowed to buy it from someone or sell it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The protections that this amendment gives the people are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protects you from abuse caused by drunkards and general disorder caused by consumption of alcohol
                    products</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The priviledges that this amendment gives people are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are no priviledges in this amendment, The 18th amendment was only a restriction.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>History of the 18th Amendment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Passed soon after a wartime prohibition in order to save grain
                </li>
                <li>
                    Supported mainly by protestants and women
                </li>
                <li>
                    redacted by amendment XXI
                </li>
                <li>
                    The only amendment to ever get redacted
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stayed active for 13 years
                </li>
                <li>
                    caused partly because of racism, as black people drank more whiskey than white people, and because
                    America was at war with Germany, this punished German-Americans
                </li>
                <li>
                    This caused the beginning of organized crime, as gangs realized the potential of a person's need for alcohol in their life
                </li>
            </ul>
                <h3>Effect of this amendment on daily life</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Removed a significant source of tax revenue for the government
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Took jobs away from a significant amount of people
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Caused crime because of black markets for alcohol
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many people smuggled alcohol in cars modified for extra speed to avoid or outrun the cops. This eventually led to the creation of Stock car racing, also known as NASCAR
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Actually caused more money to be spent on alcohol because it would be bought illegally, except now no taxes were coming to the government.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Brought vagrancy, malicious mischief, and public swearing statistics down by 50%
                    </li>
                </ul>
