    <h3>First of all, what is legacy?</h3>
    <p>Legacy is what we are known for, it is our successes and our mistakes, it is why people love us or hate us;
      legacy is how we will be remembered.<br>In the context of the 18th amendment, legacy is very much about
      mistakes.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Below are some images of people. You will remember who they are, because they have a legacy. One or more of
      these people have a negative legacy, because they did bad things in their lifetime. They still have a legacy,
      because all of these people are still taught about in schools or are talked about in other places.</p>
